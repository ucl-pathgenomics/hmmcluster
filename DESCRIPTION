Description: R wrapper for the HMMcluster model. This will take a nucleotide alignment in fasta format and identify / refine all regions of population structure. It returns two things: A table of all regions with their precise positions. And the assignment of sequences to each region, cluster. This works by doing two passes of the alignment. First to crudely identify regions of interest it bins the alignment into chunks where each is labelled as yes or no to containing structure. Then a second pass concatenates neighbouring crude regions, and refines the precise co-ordinates by AIC or BIC.
